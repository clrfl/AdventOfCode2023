    "If you are wondering why we have a dictionary instead of just one state: As this automaton is non-deterministic (in many cases there are two different states which we can transition into at the same time), we're using something similar to the power-set construction to execute an NFA deterministically. Please also look this concept up on YouTube if unfamiliar. Therefore we're holding all possible states that our machine can currently be in, which is part of the power set of all states. In our case we're extending this to a dictionary because we want to know how often we are in each state, as this corresponds to the number of possible \"spring arrangements\" in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we read each character of our input string `.??..?##?` we perform all possible transitions from each state that we're currently in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we're starting of with `.`, so our `states_dict` remains `{0: 1}`, because from the starting state there is only one transition with a dot, leading back to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our 2nd char however, the `?`, allows us to be either state 0 or 1, so our dict will look like this: `{0: 1, 1: 1}`. (State numbers are annotated in the bottom left corner of each box in the immage, they correspond to the string character index.)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the 3rd char we read another `?`, so \n",
    "from state 0 we can transition to 0 and 1 again, \n",
    "from state 1 we have to transition to state 2,\n",
    "so our state dict looks like this now: `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}`\n",
    "\n",
    "On the 4th char it starts to get interesting: We read another dot, which means \n",
    "from state 0 we can only transition into 0, \n",
    "from state 1 into 2,\n",
    "from state 2 into 2 as well.\n",
    "We're adding all of these up, so now we're in state 0 once, and in state 2 twice: `{0: 1, 2: 2}`\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the entire string our dictionary will look like this:\n",
    "`{5: 2, 6: 2}`\n",
    "Therefore we happened to end up on the last `#` state twice (`.#....###`,  `..#...###`) and we read one (or in theory also more) dot(s) afterwards (`.#...###.`, `..#..###.`,).\n",
